# Create Draft PR

Commit all changes, push to remote, and create a draft pull request.

## Steps

1. Run 'git status' to see changes
2. Run 'git diff' to understand what changed
3. Run 'git log' to see commit message style
4. Stage and commit changes with a concise message
5. Push branch to remote with '-u' flag
6. Make sure to check, we're using "sameerroboto" account in gh cli
7. Create draft PR using 'gh pr create --draft'

## PR Body Format

## Problem / Intent

[Why this change exists - the problem being solved or feature being added]

## Approach

[High-level concept of the solution - not a list of file changes]

## Rules

- PR title should be semantic ("feat:", "fix", "chore" type prefix)
- Do NOT include a summary of code changes or files modified
- Do NOT include a test plan with checkboxes
- Do NOT include "Generated with Claude Code" or similar footers
- Keep the PR description concise and focused on intent and approach
- Use HEREDOC for the PR body to preserve formatting
